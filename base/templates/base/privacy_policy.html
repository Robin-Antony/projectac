             social media websites, vendor pages, websites of other corporations, limited liability 
            companies, etc. or to InstantFix-owned websites or other InstantFix owned platforms on which it is not 
            posted. It also does not apply to information collected through other channels, such as over the phone or 
            in person. 
            By installing any third-party application, you are authorizing such third-party application to perform the 
            actions and/or share with the third-party application the information communicated to [InstantFix], or 
            requested from [InstantFix] to perform the actions and/or share with the third-party application the 
            information communicated to [InstantFix], or requested from [InstantFix]. InstantFix is going to send 
            that information through the third-party application, which will then go through the internet. [InstantFix] 
            shall not be held responsible for any dissemination, use, misuse, and/or disclosure of the user's 
            information through use of this or any third-party application. 
            Some of the information we collect through this Site may be “personal information”—information that 
            identifies you personally, alone or in combination with other information available to us. Other 
            information may be non-personally identifiable, such as information collected by cookies. 
            This Policy may be supplemented or amended from time to time by additional privacy notices (“Privacy 
            Notices”), provided at the time we collect your information. For example, certain pages of this Site may 
            contain Privacy Notices providing more details about the information we collect on those particular 
            pages, why we need that information, and choices you may have about the ways we use that information. 
            In other cases, specific Privacy Notices may be required to comply with the privacy laws of one of the 
            countries, provinces, or states in which we do business. 
        </p>

            The information we receive may depend on your browser or device settings. The information we receive 
            from your web browser and device typically is not, in and of itself, personally identifiable. However, we 
            may combine it with other information in an attempt to identify you or we may combine it with 
            information that does identify you.

            and how long they stay on each page.

            advertisements either on this Site or on other websites. 
            You have choices about the collection of information by third parties on our Sites. For example, if you 
            don't want information about your visit to this Site sent to Google Analytics, you may download an Opt out Browser Add-on by selecting a browser add-on here. Please note that the Add-on does not prevent

            It may be that some of the third parties that collect interest-based information on this Site do not 
            participate in the industry-developed opt-out website, in which case the best way to avoid third-party 
            tracking of your online behaviors may be through your browser settings and deletion of cookies. Please

        <p>With Third-Party Vendors. InstantFix shares information collected through this Site with third-party 
            vendors who act for us or on our behalf. For example, we may use third-party vendors to design and 
            operate this Site; to conduct surveys; and to help us with our promotional efforts. These third-party 
            vendors may need information about you to perform their functions. 
            With Other Users of this Site. You may be able to submit User-Generated Content on or through this Site. 
            In this Policy, “User-Generated Content” or “UGC” refers to content that you post using the social 
            networking tools we make available to you and that does not constitute “Feedback” (as that term is 
            defined in our Terms of Use. Any personal information contained in UGC can be read, collected, or used 
            by others. 
            In addition, we may use UGC you submit for advertising campaigns and other promotions. We may or 
            may not use your name in connection with such use, and we may or may not seek your consent before 
            using the content for such purposes. Therefore, you should have no expectation of privacy with respect to 
            UGC you submit on or through this Site. 
            With Third-Party Social Media Platforms. We may provide functionality on this Site that allows you to 
            automatically post information about the actions you take on this Site to a third-party social media 
            platform (such as Facebook or Twitter). If you choose to take advantage of this functionality, people with 
            access to your profile on the third-party platform may be able to see the actions you have taken—for 
            example, the products or services you have purchased. Thus, you should have no expectation of privacy 
            in those actions. 
            Further, if you choose to link your profile on this Site with an account on a third-party social media 
            platform, we may share the information in your profile with that third-party platform. We may also use 
            third-party social media platforms to offer you interest-based ads. To offer such ads, we may convert your 
            email address into a unique value which can be matched by our partner company with a user on their 
            platform. Although we do not provide any personal information to these platform vendors, they may gain 
            insights about individuals who respond to the ads we serve. 
            Within InstantFix Corporate Family. We may share information collected through this Site with other 
            companies in InstantFix corporate structure. These affiliate companies are permitted to use your

            With Other, Carefully Selected Business Partners. From time to time, we may share your information 
            with selected third parties for their own marketing purposes. For example, we may partner with third 
            parties to sponsor contests or other promotions, and we may share with these third parties the information 
            you submit to us to participate in the contest or take advantage of the promotion. Before doing so, 
            however, we may offer you the opportunity to “opt out” or “opt in,” as required by applicable law. 
            In Aggregate or De-Identified Form. We use information collected through this Site to create a compiled, 
            aggregate view of usage patterns. We may share aggregate information with third parties so they can 
            better understand our user base. We may also share, with third parties, information about how particular 
            individuals use this Site, but only on a de-identified basis (“Individualized Data”). Individualized Data is 
            not personally identifiable, but it does reflect the usage patterns of a particular Site user, as opposed to 
            Site users collectively. 
            As Part of a Business Transfer. Your information may be transferred to successor organization if, for 
            example, we transfer the ownership or operation of this Site to another organization or if we merge with 
            another organization or liquidate our assets. If such a transfer occurs, the successor organization's use of 
            your information will still be subject to this Policy and the privacy preferences you have expressed to us. 
            To Comply with Laws and Protect Our Rights and the Rights of Others. We may disclose your

            order or a subpoena. We may also disclose your information to prevent or investigate a possible crime, 
            such as fraud or identity theft; to protect the security of this Site; to enforce or apply our online Terms of 
            Use or other agreements; or to protect our own rights or property or the rights, property or safety of our 
            users or others.
