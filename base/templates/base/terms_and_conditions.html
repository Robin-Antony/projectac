            You are responsible for User-Generated Content that you post. Under no circumstances will we be liable 
            in any way for any UGC. 
            This means that you, not InstantFix, are entirely responsible for all UGC that you post and that you can 
            be held personally liable for comments that are defamatory, obscene, or libelous, or that violate these 
            Terms of Use, an obligation of confidentiality, or the rights of others. If any part of the UGC you post is 
            not your original work, it is your responsibility to obtain any necessary permission to post it. 
            Because we do not control the UGC posted on or through this Site, we cannot and do not warrant or 
            guarantee the truthfulness, integrity, suitability, or quality of that UGC. You also agree and understand 
            that by accessing this Site, you may encounter UGC that you may consider to be objectionable. We have 
            no responsibility for any UGC, including without limitation any errors or omissions therein. We are not 
            liable for any loss or damage of any kind you may claim was incurred as a result of the use of any UGC 
            posted, emailed, transmitted or otherwise made available on or through this Site. The UGC posted on or 
            through this Site expresses the personal opinions of the individuals who posted it and does not 
            necessarily 
            reflect the views of InstantFix or any person or entity associated with InstantFix.

            same. For this reason, we ask that you not post any UGC that you do not wish to license to us, including

            remove or block any UGC at any time without notice at our sole and absolute discretion;

            believe that disclosure is appropriate to comply with the law or a court order, to prevent or investigate a 
            possible crime or other violation of law, to protect the rights of InstantFix or others, or to enforce these 
            Terms of Use; and

        <h2 id="16">Removal of Content</h2>
        <p>
            In general. You can seek removal of objectionable UGC by contacting us using the information provided 
            below. We will review all such requests and will remove UGC that we determine should be removed, in 
            our sole discretion and in accordance with these Terms of Use and applicable law. Please be aware, 
            however, that if the UGC has already been distributed to other websites or published in other media, we 
            will not be able to recapture and delete it. Also, a back-up or residual copy of the UGC we remove from 
            this Site may remain on back-up servers. 
            Violation of copyrights. InstantFix does not knowingly violate or permit others to violate the copyrights 
            of others. We will promptly remove or disable access to material that we know is infringing or if we 
            become aware of circumstances from which infringing activity is apparent. 
            If you are requesting removal of content because of a violation of your copyrights, please note that the 
            Digital Millennium Copyright Act of 1998 (the “DMCA”) provides recourse for copyright owners who 
            believe that material appearing on the Internet infringes their rights under Indian copyright law. If you 
            believe that your own work, or the work of a third party for whom you are authorized to act, is featured 
            on this Site or has been otherwise copied and made available on this Site in a manner that constitute 
            copyright infringement, please notify us immediately. Your notice must be in writing and must include 
            an electronic or physical signature of the copyright owner or of the person authorized to act on behalf of 
            the owner of the copyright interest; 
            a description of the copyrighted work that you claim has been infringed; 
            a description of where the material that you claim is infringing is located on this Site (including the URL, 
            title and/or item number if applicable, or other identifying characteristics); 
            your name, address, telephone number, and email address, and, if you are not the owner of the 
            copyright, 
            the name of the owner; and 
            a written statement by you that you have a good-faith belief that the disputed use is not authorized by 
            the 
            copyright owner, its agent, or the law; and 
            a statement by you, made under penalty of perjury, that the above information in your notice is 
            accurate 
            and that you are the copyright owner or authorized to act on the copyright owner's behalf. 
            Your statement must be sent to: copyright@dwyergroup.com 
            Any notification by a copyright owner or a person authorized to act on its behalf that fails to comply 
            with 
            requirements of the DMCA shall not be considered sufficient notice and shall not be deemed to confer 
            upon us actual knowledge of facts or circumstances from which infringing material or acts are evident.
